Welcome! This is the repository for Toadal Mayhem! I (Michael Buoni) have been working on this game mostly by myself since the beginning of August this year.

## Gameplay
It is a 2D platformer game, meaning the main goal is to get to the other side of each level. Additionally, you can grab onto walls and jump off of them, and you can also use your tongue to stop time and retract it to move you in unique ways around the stage.

### Controls
The default controls for keyboard are the following: Arrow keys to move, up key to jump, hold X to use the tonguedash ability, hold Z to grab onto walls, Esc to pause the game and go into a menu, and f11 for fullscreen, X and Z can be used as confirmation and back buttons in menus.
The game also supports custom key remappings which can be found in the pause menu through options. (Please note that not all of the necessary icons have been made yet, so some controller buttons may show up as just numbers, that is normal, also controls do not save when you close the game yet)

You can also use game controllers if you have them! If the controller has drivers for windows, it should work as soon as you plug it in. Using a controller will disable the keyboard controls until you disconnect it.
You can also remap the controls on the controller through the same method.

### How to Use the Tonguedash Ability
You can press and hold X to use the ability. Move the tongue around using the arrow keys and the player will follow it once it is fully used up. You have 2 seconds max to move the tongue. Letting go of X before it is over will cause it to end prematurely.

## Development Information

### When Will This Be Released?

I'm currently planning on releasing the demo for the game either late 2025 or early 2026. For the full game, it's hard to give an estimate but it would probably be mid to late 2026.

### How Big Will The Game Be?

My plan is to have enough to get a good feel for what the game should be like in the demo, so I will have the first 10 introductory levels in the demo, including the first boss fight. I want it to be a very polished representation of what the full game will be like.

My current plans for the full game are to have 40 main levels, with each set of 10 having a unique theme. There will be 4 bosses and a story to tie it all together. Additionally, my friend offered to help make a few extra challenging levels for after the game is finished, there will probably be 5 or so of these. I'm also planning for there to be some extra fun interactions like a frog select screen when you first play the game which will change the frog you play as.
